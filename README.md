# EREBRUS

We are trying to implement a Utility NFT where subscription, royalty for the creator, 
and rental facilities are available, 
the NFT will be disclosed on the closing date, 
and the wallet address will be whitelisted prior to that. 
Be prepared for these changes.Utility non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are 
digital assets that represent a right or 
access to a service or product. They are 
similar to traditional NFTs in that they
 are unique and cannot be exchanged for other
  tokens on a one-to-one basis, but they differ in 
  that they have a specific use beyond being a collectible 
  or piece of artwork.
